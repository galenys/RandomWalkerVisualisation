# Random Walk Histogram Visualiser

This is a simulation of several random walkers, with a histogram of the distances from the origin displayed at the bottom of the screen. It's a good visualisation of the central limit theorem (the histogram ends up normally distributed). I will try to add controls for the number of walkers and a few other things at some point. For now you can change constants in the code.
